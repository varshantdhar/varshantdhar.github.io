## About me
My name is [Varshant Dhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varshant-dhar/). I currently work as an Applied Scientist at [Ripple](https://ripple.com/). My background is in Statistics and Computer Science which I studied at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) from 2015-2019 and the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) from 2019-2021.

This repository contains my research paper reading notes on deep learning and machine learning. NOTE: Some are incomplete as I work on these regularly.
